# Cshell
### Very simple shell written in C

This was written purely for fun and as a challenge if I could write a very simple shell, completely written in C and without any other kind of help other than man pages from the terminal.

You can download and compile using Makefile by just typing make into terminal.
Then run using ./csh

If anyone can find any exploits be sure to let me know in the issues section of this repository!
