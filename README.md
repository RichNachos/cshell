# CShell
## Very simple shell written in C

This was written purely for fun and as a challenge if I could write a very simple shell, completely written in C and without any other kind of help other than man pages from the terminal.

## Compiling and running
```
$ sudo apt install make gcc
$ make
$ ./csh
```

The shell program can fork and call any other program and can move up and down directories using `cd`
